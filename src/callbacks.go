/*
Work around the problems of C that expects you to define functions with the same name,
and avoid collisions through selective linking or #ifdefs.

Here the C `kiss_process_msg` can call `kiss_process_msg_override`, and *that* can call a function defined in (e.g.) `cmd/kissutil/main.go` via the variable.

If kiss_process_msg tried to call something defined in cmd/kissutil directly, it was fine for kissutil, but would fail for e.g. cmd/atest

Only use Go types for the variable because C types end up different (C.int vs direwolf.C.int)
