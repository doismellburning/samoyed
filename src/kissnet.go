package direwolf

/*------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Purpose:   	Provide service to other applications via KISS protocol via TCP socket.
 *
 * Input:
 *
 * Outputs:
 *
 * Description:	This provides a TCP socket for communication with a client application.
 *
 *		It implements the KISS TNS protocol as described in:
 *		http://www.ka9q.net/papers/kiss.html
 *
 * 		Briefly, a frame is composed of
 *
 *			* FEND (0xC0)
 *			* Contents - with special escape sequences so a 0xc0
 *				byte in the data is not taken as end of frame.
 *				as part of the data.
 *			* FEND
 *
 *		The first byte of the frame contains:
 *
 *			* port number in upper nybble.
 *			* command in lower nybble.
 *
 *
 *		Commands from application recognized:
 *
 *			_0	Data Frame	AX.25 frame in raw format.
 *
 *			_1	TXDELAY		See explanation in xmit.c.
 *
 *			_2	Persistence	"	"
 *
 *			_3 	SlotTime	"	"
 *
 *			_4	TXtail		"	"
 *						Spec says it is obsolete but Xastir
 *						sends it and we respect it.
 *
 *			_5	FullDuplex	Ignored.
 *
 *			_6	SetHardware	TNC specific.
 *
 *			FF	Return		Exit KISS mode.  Ignored.
 *
 *
 *		Messages sent to client application:
 *
 *			_0	Data Frame	Received AX.25 frame in raw format.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * References:	Getting Started with Winsock
 *		http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb530742(v=vs.85).aspx
 *
 * Future:	Originally we had:
 *			KISS over serial port.
 *			AGW over socket.
 *		This is the two of them munged together and we end up with duplicate code.
 *		It would have been better to separate out the transport and application layers.
 *		Maybe someday.

/*
	Separate TCP ports per radio:

An increasing number of people are using multiple radios.
direwolf is capable of handling many radio channels and
provides cross-band repeating, etc.
Maybe a single stereo audio interface is used for 2 radios.

                   +------------+    tcp 8001, all channels
Radio A  --------  |            |  -------------------------- Application A
                   |  direwolf  |
Radio B  --------  |            |  -------------------------- Application B
                   +------------+    tcp 8001, all channels

The KISS protocol has a 4 bit field for the TNC port (which I prefer to
call channel because port has too many different meanings).
direwolf handles this fine.  However, most applications were written assuming
that a TNC could only talk to a single radio.  On reception, they ignore the
channel in the KISS frame.  For transmit, the channel is always set to 0.

Many people are using the work-around of two separate instances of direwolf.

                   +------------+    tcp 8001, KISS ch 0
Radio A  --------  |  direwolf  |  -------------------------- Application A
                   +------------+

                   +------------+    tcp 8002, KISS ch 0
Radio B  --------  |  direwolf  |  -------------------------- Application B
                   +------------+


Or they might be using a single application that knows how to talk to multiple
single port TNCs.  But they don't know how to multiplex multiple channels
thru a single KISS stream.

                   +------------+    tcp 8001, KISS ch 0
Radio A  --------  |  direwolf  |  ------------------------
                   +------------+                          \
                                                            -- Application
                   +------------+    tcp 8002, KISS ch 0   /
Radio B  --------  |  direwolf  |  ------------------------
                   +------------+

Using two different instances of direwolf means more complex configuration
and loss of cross-channel digipeating.  It is possible to use a stereo
audio interface but some ALSA magic is required to make it look like two
independent virtual mono interfaces.

In version 1.7, we add the capability of multiple KISS TCP ports, each for
a single radio channel.  e.g.

KISSPORT 8001 1
KISSPORT 8002 2

Now can use a single instance of direwolf.


                   +------------+    tcp 8001, KISS ch 0
Radio A  --------  |            |  -------------------------- Application A
                   |  direwolf  |
Radio B  --------  |            |  -------------------------- Application B
                   +------------+    tcp 8002, KISS ch 0

When receiving, the KISS channel is set to 0.
 - only radio channel 1 would be sent over tcp port 8001.
 - only radio channel 2 would be sent over tcp port 8001.

When transmitting, the KISS channel is ignored.
 - frames from tcp port 8001 are transmitted on radio channel 1.
 - frames from tcp port 8002 are transmitted on radio channel 2.

Of course, you could also use an application, capable of connecting to
multiple single radio TNCs.  Separate TCP ports actually go to the
same direwolf instance.
