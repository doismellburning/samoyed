 *
 * Module:      recv.c
 *
 * Purpose:   	Process audio input for receiving.
 *
 *		This is for all platforms.
 *
 *
 * Description:	In earlier versions, we supported a single audio device
 *		and the main program looped around processing the
 *		audio samples.  The structure looked like this:
 *
 *		main in direwolf.c:
 *
 *			audio_init()
 *			various other *_init()
 *
 *			loop forever:
 *				s = demod_get_sample.
 *				multi_modem_process_sample(s)
 *
 *
 *		When a packet is successfully decoded, somebody calls
 *		app_process_rec_frame, also in direwolf.c
 *
 *
 *		Starting in version 1.2, we support multiple audio
 *		devices at the same time.  We now have a separate
 *		thread for each audio device.   Decoded frames are
 *		sent to a single queue for serial processing.
 *
 *		The new flow looks like this:
 *
 *		main in direwolf.c:
 *
 *			audio_init()
 *			various other *_init()
 *			recv_init()
 *			recv_process()  -- does not return
 *
 *
 *		recv_init()		This starts up a separate thread
 *					for each audio device.
 *					Each thread reads audio samples and
 *					passes them to multi_modem_process_sample.
 *
 *					The difference is that app_process_rec_frame
 *					is no longer called directly.  Instead
 *					the frame is appended to a queue with dlq_rec_frame.
 *
 *					Received frames can now be processed one at
 *					a time and we don't need to worry about later
 *					processing being reentrant.
 *
 *		recv_process()  	This simply waits for something to show up
 *					in the dlq queue and calls app_process_rec_frame
 *					for each.
