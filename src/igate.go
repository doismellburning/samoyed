	// (00001010) at the end of APRS packets.   This would be in violation of the

	// The MIC-E position format can have non printable characters (0x1c ... 0x1f, 0x7f)

	// The base 91 telemetry format (http://he.fi/doc/aprs-base91-comment-telemetry.txt ),

	// The APRS Spec Addendum 1.2 Proposals ( http://www.aprs.org/aprs12/datum.txt)
	// adds use of UTF-8 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 )for the free form text in
	// messages and comments. It can't be used in the fixed width fields.
	//
	// Non-ASCII characters are represented by multi-byte sequences.  All bytes in these
	// multi-byte sequences have the most significant bit set to 1.  Using UTF-8 would not
	// add any nul (00000000) bytes to the stream.

 * Name:        rx_to_ig_remember

 * Purpose:	Check whether this is a duplicate of another
 *		recently received from RF and sent to the Server
 *

 * Returns:	True if it is OK to send.
 *
 *-------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Description: These two functions perform the final stage of filtering
 *		before sending a received (from radio) packet to the IGate server.
 *
 *		rx_to_ig_remember must be called for every packet sent to the server.
 *
 *		rx_to_ig_allow decides whether this should be allowed thru
 *		based on recent activity.  We will drop the packet if it is a
 *		duplicate of another sent recently.
 *
 *		Rather than storing the entire packet, we just keep a CRC to
 *		reduce memory and processing requirements.  We do the same in
 *		the digipeater function to suppress duplicates.
 *
 *		There is a 1 / 65536 chance of getting a false positive match
 *		which is good enough for this application.
 *
 *
 * Original thinking:
 *
 *		Occasionally someone will get on one of the discussion groups and say:
 *		I don't think my IGate is working.  I look at packets, from local stations,
 *		on aprs.fi or findu.com, and they are always through some other IGate station,
 *		never mine.
 *		Then someone has to explain, this is not a valid strategy for analyzing
 *		everything going thru the network.   The APRS-IS servers drop duplicate
 *		packets (ignoring the via path) within a 30 second period.  If some
 *		other IGate gets the same thing there a millisecond faster than you,
 *		the one you send is discarded.
 *		In this scenario, it would make sense to perform additional duplicate
 *		suppression before forwarding RF packets to the Server.
 *		I don't recall if I saw some specific recommendation to do this or if
 *		it just seemed like the obvious thing to do to avoid sending useless
 *		stuff that would just be discarded anyhow.  It seems others came to the
 *		same conclusion.  http://www.tapr.org/pipermail/aprssig/2016-July/045907.html
 *
 * Version 1.5:	Rethink strategy.
 *
 *		Issue 85, https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf/issues/85 ,
 *		got me thinking about this some more.  Sending more information will
 *		allow the APRS-IS servers to perform future additional network analysis.
 *		To make a long story short, the RF>IS direction duplicate checking
 *		is now disabled.   The code is still there in case I change my mind
 *		and want to add a configuration option to allow it.  The dedupe
 *		time is set to 0 which means don't do the checking.

 *
 *		>>> The receive IGate spec says a packet should be cut at a CR. <<<
 *

 *		idea to replace unprintable characters with spaces.  How's that working out for MIC-E position???)
 *
 *		At first I was tempted to remove any trailing spaces to make up for the other
 *		IGate adding it.  Two wrongs don't make a right.   Trailing spaces are not that
 *		rare and removing them would corrupt the data.  My new strategy is for
 *		the duplicate detection compare to ignore trailing space, CR, and LF.
 *
 *		We already transmitted the same thing by the digipeater function so this should
 *		also go into memory for avoiding duplicates out of the transmit IGate.
 *
 * Future:
 *		Should the digipeater function avoid transmitting something if it
 *		was recently transmitted by the IGate function?
 *		This code is pretty much the same as dedupe.c. Maybe it could all
 *		be combined into one.  Need to ponder this some more.
