/*------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Purpose:	Maintain a list of all stations heard.
 *
 * Description: This was added for IGate statistics and checking if a user is local
 *		but would also be useful for the AGW network protocol 'H' request.
 *
 *		This application has no GUI and is not interactive so
 *		I'm not sure what else we might do with the information.
 *
 *		Why mheard instead of just heard?  The KPC-3+ has an MHEARD command
 *		to list stations heard.  I guess that stuck in my mind.
 *		It should be noted that here "heard" refers to the AX.25 source station.
 *		Before printing the received packet, the "heard" line refers to who
 *		we heard over the radio.  This would be the digipeater with "*" after
 *		its name.
 *
 * Future Ideas: Someone suggested using SQLite to store the information
 *		so other applications could access it.

 *
 *		Lynn KJ4ERJ:
 *
 *			For APRSISCE/32, "Local" is defined as those stations to which messages
 *			would be gated if any are received from the APRS-IS.  This currently
 *			means unique stations heard within the past 30 minutes with at most two
 *			used path hops.
 *
 *			I added DIR_CNT and RF_CNT with comma delimiters to APRSISCE/32's IGate
 *			status.  DIR_CNT is the count of unique stations received on RF in the
 *			past 30 minutes with no used hops.  RF_CNT is the total count of unique
 *			stations received on RF in the past 30 minutes.
 *
 *		Steve K4HG:
 *
 *			The number of hops defining local should match the number of hops of the
 *			outgoing packets from the IGate. So if the path is only WIDE, then local
 *			should only be stations heard direct or through one hop. From the beginning
 *			I was very much against on a standardization of the outgoing IGate path,
 *			hams should be free to manage their local RF network in a way that works
 *			for them. Busy areas one hop may be best, I lived in an area where three was
 *			a much better choice. I avoided as much as possible prescribing anything
 *			that might change between locations.
 *
 *			The intent was how many stations are there for which messages could be IGated.
 *			IGate software keeps an internal list of the 'local' stations so it knows
 *			when to IGate a message, and this number should be the length of that list.
 *			Some IGates have a parameter for local timeout, 1 hour was the original default,
 *			so if in an hour the IGate has not heard another local packet the station is
 *			dropped from the local list. Messages will no longer be IGated to that station
 *			and the station count would drop by one. The number should not just continue to rise.
